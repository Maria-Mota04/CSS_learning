POSTION: sets how an element is positioned in a document. (NOT INHERITED)
            The top, right, bottom, and left properties 
            determine the final location of positioned elements.

    STATIC(default) -> positioned according to the normal flow
                    L> top, right... and z-index have no effect

    RELATIVE -> according to normmal flow
            L> can offset it relative to top, right... not affecting other elements,
             they assume he is taking his original space
                    SO I CAN MOVE IT WITHOUT MOVING OTHER ELEMENTS, BUT ORIGINAL SPACE SAVED
            L> space for the element same as static
            L> z-index usable

    ABSOLUTE -> removed from the normal flow
            L> no space created for the element, SO OTHER ELEMENTS ACTS AS IF IT DID NOT EXIST
            L> position relative to the closest ancestor or initial containing block
            L> top, right... usable
            L> z-index usable
            L> margins cant be collapsed

    FIXED -> removed from the normal flow -> ex: if it was block it doesnt take 100% width anymore
            L> no space created
            L> SAME AS ABSOLUTE, BUT THE RELATIVE POSITION CHANGES
            L> position relative to initial containing block(maybe viewport)
            L> top, right,... usable
            L>s-index usable
            L> USED FOR FLOATING AN ELEMENT THAT STAYS IN THE SAME POSITION WHEN SCROLLING

    STICKY -> normal document flow
            L>SIMILAR TO FIXED, but stays in the normal flow until it reaches the position I defined
            L> position relative nearest SCROLLING ANCESTOR and containing block
            L> top,... usable, offset doesnt affect other elements
            L> z-index usable
            L> STICKS TO THE NEAREST ANCESTOR
            L> can be used for sticky lists, like alphabet with words

            L> stops being sticky when I reach the containers boundary or it becomes invisible.
                    L> remains stuck until another container passes it




    NOTE: removed from the normal document flow => doesnt affect others
        ANCESTOR - element that encloses my element -> SHOULD ALWAYS BE POSITIONED RELATIVE FOR 
                                                        ABSOLUTE, STICKY ..
                                                    -> IF ANCESTOR IS STATIC,
                                                     THEN THE ABSOLUTE CHILD WILL BE 
                                                     RELATIVE TO THE INITIAL CONTAINING BLOCK
                L> if ancestor is:
                    - relative: serves as reference point for absolute children



        INITIAL CONTAINING BLOCK: iewport or the root element

        SCROLLING ANCESTOR(STICKY): has overflow defined

        THE ORDER: the order without z-index(default = 0) is determined by the order 
        in reverse from the html stucture

        INVISIBLE CONTAINERS: I can do top: -10000px; it will still be a part of the document,
        but will be hidden
