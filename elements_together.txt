COLORS: -> I can move the top bar, to choose form rgba,hsl ,#,  and the right bar for the alpha parameter = transparency

background-color: changes the whole background color, #six digits, rgba(0,0,0,transparent = 0), rgb(NOT INHERITED)
color: font color, #RRGGBB, first two red etc, if R=R, G=G, B=B, #FF0000 = #F00(NOT INHERITED)
L> I can also have hsl(hue saturation lightness) and hsla (100% = white), hue = which color it is(color wheel from 0 to 360), saturation = intensity of the color I have(between full color and grey), lightness = how light or dark


FONT:

font-style: ex italic (INHERITED)
font-size
text-transform: how to capitalize an element's text(INHERITED)
font-family: prioritized list of one or more font family names(INHERITED)
line-height: number | length | percentage | normal, sets the  height of a line box in horizontal (INHERITED)


AROUND:

border: width, style, color EX:  thick double #32a1ce; (NOT INHERITED)
outline: width, style, color EX: 3px solid green; (NOT INHERITED) -> DONT TAKE UP SPACE INSIDE,!= BORDER



MULTI:

background: color, image, origin, size, repeat-method, attachment, clip, position




GLOBAL VALUES: ex

outline: inherit; -> inherits from the parent
outline: initial; -> resets to the initial/default value, usually none
outline: revert; -> reverts the value of a property to what it would have been if the current stylesheet (or the current layer) didn't apply.
outline: revert-layer; -> r essentially ignores the current cascade layer (e.g., the author stylesheet) and reverts the property to its value from the previous cascade layer.
outline: unset; ->  Acts as inherit if the property is inheritable, otherwise acts as initial.




--------------------------------------------

UNITS FOR MEASUREMENTS:

ABSOLUTE: pixels = px -> not recomended because its static for fonts, but for borders for example is good

RELATIVE:
    - percentage: usually related to the parents size

    - REM: usually for fontsize, related to the root element

    - EM: looks for the main element, the parent for fontsize, but for padding, margin it looks for the fontsize
        SO IT LOOKS FOR THE NEAREST FONT-SIZE AND USES THAT AS REFERENCE
        -> not recomended for font, but yes for the padding, margin, button etc because it uses the element iself as reference

    -CH- character - helps determine character width - based on the character '0's width

    -VW,WH- viewport width and height - % is usually better than vw
        - vh is good to make the body element bigger without adding elements, using min-height = 100vh

USER STYLE SHEETS

Summary

    Browser Default Styles: Basic styles applied by the browser.

    User Stylesheets: Custom styles applied by the user to override site styles.

    Author Stylesheets: Styles provided by the website developer (external, internal, and inline).

    User-Agent Stylesheets: Special fallback styles applied by the browser.

The cascade in CSS determines how these styles interact, with inline styles typically having the most power, followed by author styles, user styles, and finally browser default styles.

CSS RESET

*{
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    border: 0;
    font-size: 100%;
    font: inherit;
    vertical-align: baseline;
}

Consistency: Browsers apply their own default styles, which can vary. A reset helps standardize element appearance across different browsers.

Simplify Styling: By removing default browser styles, you can more easily control the look and feel of your web page.

Reduce Bugs: Minimizes styling issues caused by inconsistent default browser styles.

CSS Reset: A method to remove default browser styles for consistency and ease of styling.
