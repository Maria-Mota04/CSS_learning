GLOBAL VALUES: ex

outline: initial; -> resets to the initial/default value, usually none
outline: revert; -> reverts the value of a property to what it would have been if the current stylesheet (or the current layer) didn't apply.
outline: revert-layer; -> r essentially ignores the current cascade layer (e.g., the author stylesheet) and reverts the property to its value from the previous cascade layer.
outline: unset; ->  Acts as inherit if the property is inheritable, otherwise acts as initial.
