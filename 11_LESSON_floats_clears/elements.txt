FLOAT:(NOT INHERITED)

    L> The element is removed from the normal flow of the page SO IF I APPLY MARGIN TO OTHER CONTENT IT wont
            AFFECT THE FLOATED ITEM(i should add margin to the actual block)
    L> still remaining a part of the flow

    L> places an element on the left or right side of its container,
    L> allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. (TEXT WRAPPING)

    L> floating elements behave like blocks in layout.

    L> IF I DONT WANT OTHER CONTENT WRAPPING AROUND,
        if I have a container around it:
            I can display: flow-root(in the container I have behind it), so the container wont shrink
        
        Otherwise do: clear:both as a separate class and add it to what I want
