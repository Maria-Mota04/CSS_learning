Summary

    Browser Default Styles: Basic styles applied by the browser.

    User Stylesheets: Custom styles applied by the user to override site styles.

    Author Stylesheets: Styles provided by the website developer (external, internal, and inline).

    User-Agent Stylesheets: Special fallback styles applied by the browser.

The cascade in CSS determines how these styles interact, with inline styles typically having the most power, followed by author styles, user styles, and finally browser default styles.
