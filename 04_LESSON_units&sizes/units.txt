units determine the size of everything in your page

ex: font-size: units

ABSOLUTE: pixels = px -> not recomended because its static for fonts, but for borders for example is good

RELATIVE:
    - percentage: usually related to the parents size

    - REM: usually for fontsize, related to the root element

    - EM: looks for the main element, the parent for fontsize, but for padding, margin it looks for the fontsize
        SO IT LOOKS FOR THE NEAREST FONT-SIZE AND USES THAT AS REFERENCE
        -> not recomended for font, but yes for the padding, margin, button etc because it uses the element iself as reference

    -CH- character - helps determine character width - based on the character '0's width

    -VW,WH- viewport width and height - % is usually better than vw
        - vh is good to make the body element bigger without adding elements, using min-height = 100vh
