SIZE:

box-sizing: sets how the total width and height of an element is calculated
            1- content-box: default,  If you set an element's width to 100 pixels, 
            then the element's content box will be 100 pixels wide, and the width of any border or 
            padding will be added to the final rendered width, making the element wider than 100px.

            2- BORDER-BOX(BEST ONE):  tells the browser to account for any border and padding
             in the values you specify for an element's width and height.
             SO IF YOU SET AN ELEMENT'S WIDTH TO 100 PIXELS,
              THAT 100 PIXELS WILL INCLUDE ANY BORDER OR PADDING YOU ADDED -> DOES NOT INCLUDE MARGIN, CAUSE 
              THAT IS OUTSIDE, OR OUTLINE

AROUND LINE:

border: width, style, color EX:  thick double #32a1ce; there are also sides like the bellow ones (NOT INHERITED)
outline: width, style, color EX: 3px solid green; -> DONT TAKE UP SPACE INSIDE, GOES OUTSIDE,!= BORDER(NOT INHERITED)
    L> I can also have an outline - offset, that gives me a distance of the line from our box,
     I can use negative values to get inside the box



AROUND SPACE:

padding: top, right, bottom, left == top bottom, left right == top, right left, bottom; if its a percentage -> relative to inline size 
L> creates extra space within an element.(NOT INHERITED)
margin: same as padding -> Margins create extra space around an element != padding (NOT INHERITED)

NOTE -> DOING MARGIN: x px AUTO, the auto centers the box
