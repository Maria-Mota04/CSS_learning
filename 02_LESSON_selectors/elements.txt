TEXT:
font-style: ex italic(INHERITED)
text-transform: how to capitalize an element's text(INHERITED)
font-family: prioritized list of one or more font family names(INHERITED)

COLOR:
background-color: color of the background (NOT INHERITED)


AROUND:
border: width, style, color EX:  thick double #32a1ce; (NOT INHERITED)
outline: width, style, color EX: 3px solid green; (NOT INHERITED)

note -> outline differences from border:
    Outlines never take up space, as they are drawn outside of an element's content.
    According to the spec, outlines don't have to be rectangular, although they usually are.


GLOBAL VALUES: ex

outline: inherit; -> inherits from the parent
outline: initial; -> resets to the initial/default value, usually none
outline: revert; -> reverts the value of a property to what it would have been if the current stylesheet (or the current layer) didn't apply.
outline: revert-layer; -> r essentially ignores the current cascade layer (e.g., the author stylesheet) and reverts the property to its value from the previous cascade layer.
outline: unset; ->  Acts as inherit if the property is inheritable, otherwise acts as initial.
